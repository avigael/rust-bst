# Binary Search Trees

This project is written in Rust. To run this project please [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install "install") Rust on your machine.

This is a basic binary search tree written in Rust. See this article for more information about [BSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree "BSTs").

**Instructions**: To run this project with cargo, execute the following command:
```
$ cargo test
```

### Note:

Recursion is not encouraged in Rust. For medium-sized data structures, recursive operations will quickly blow up the stack. Thus, I've implemented all operations using loops instead of recursion.
